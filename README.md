# ASUS CSS Framework

A mobile-first framework for usage in ASUS' latest micro sites. This framework is forked from [twbs/bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) as well as [zurb/foundation](https://github.com/zurb/foundation) (our favorite bits of each) plus some custom junk thrown in for good measure.

## ITCSS

This project follows Inverted Triangle CSS (ITCSS) by Harry "CSS Wizardry" Roberts. Files should be organized by groups which are described in detail below. As we go down our list of files we should go from:

* Generic to explicit
* Far-reaching to localised
* Low specificity to high specificity

You may add in new layers to the system, say in between "components" and "trumps" you can place "theme", just make sure you're adding them in the correct place regarding explicitness, reach and specificity. You don't <strong>have</strong> to add in a new layer though, just keep adding files to existing layers as you need them.

## Installation

We are currently using [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) for our workflow. This will compile and minify all static files and output them into a folder for distribution.

To begin, you must install the dependencies if you haven't already.

* npm: http://npmjs.org/
* node.js: http://nodejs.org/download/
* sass: just run `bundle install` ([bundler is required](http://bundler.io/))

Once npm is installed get your cli up and running and install gulp: `npm install gulp -g`.

Fork this repo if you haven't already and `cd` into your local file where the `package.json` file is located in the root. From there, simply type: `npm install`. This will read the `package.json` file and download all the necessities.

Now that we're ready, you can start editing the `.scss` and simply type in `gulp` while sitting pretty in the working folder and it will build everything for you!

If you type in `gulp watch`, this will start up a static server at `localhost:5000` pointing to the dist folder. Make an index file, point to the css and you're off to the races.

This project is also using [LiveReload](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei?hl=en), so make sure that's ready too for awesome-sauce.
